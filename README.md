# UC Learn Concealer
Are you tired of looking at those classes you took last semester?

I come to you with UC Learn Concealer.

# How does this work?

Until Google aproves the extension, it has to be installed manually:

Go to :
```
chrome://extensions/
```

drop the contents of this repo into the page.

Congratulations, you have installed the extension.

After you install this extension navigate to your UC Learn Dashboard page.

Once the plugin loads the classes you can click on the plugin context menu ( the one on the top right) and select what classes you want to hide.

Easy aye?

Enjoy.
